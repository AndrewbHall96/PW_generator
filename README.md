# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This project generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. It runs in the browser and features dynamically HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. The interface is responsive and produces a code based on the user's selection.This code ultimately provides an employer with a randomly generated password that can  meet certain criteria to ensure a strong password.

I approached this code first by psuedo coding, identifying which criteria the password needed to meet. Following this, I defined the necessary variables along with "confirm's" and "prompt's"
